# Affiliate Link Redirect Stripper
Tired of others harvesting your purchases with affiliate links? This Chrome extension automatically redirects you to the original, non-affiliated link. Saves you time and money, allowing you to get to the deals before others and even gives you precious extra time to activate your own cashback extensions (Rakuten, Capital One, Topcashback, etc)!

To be clear, this extension will NOT invalidate any cashback trips you make through an extension or anything of this nature - this extension only targets shortened links that are often sent online via social media from influencers. This extension has no ill effect on all three major cashback extensions I've tested thus far.
